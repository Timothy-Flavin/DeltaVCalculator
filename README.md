# DeltaVCalculator (Old and no longer applicable)
A DeltaVCalculator for Kerbal space program
# Purpose
To make those missions to Duna less annoying when you miss the atmosphere by 1 km.
1. Enter rocket statistics as prompted by terminal when run with g++ or the ide of your choice
2. reviece thrust to weight ratio, deltaV and estimated ability to reach nearby bodies for each stage
3. profit
# IMPORTANT USAGE INFO
This program was written before the aerodynamics update to kerbal space program which means its twr and deltaV calculations are no longer in line with how Ksp calculates things, and it's deltaV estimates to go to other bodies are likely also a bit off. 
# history 
I made this as a sophomore in highschool when playing ksp and taking my first programming class, intro to c++. I wanted to see if I could put c++ to good use and it was so fun to make that I ended up majoring in CS.
